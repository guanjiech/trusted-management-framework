## Overview
This repository contains a lightweight authentication scheme, a Kademlia-based storage scheme, and the HLPSL file. 
## Hyperledger Fabric
### Dependencies
- Fabric v2.4.6
- Caliper v0.5.0
### How to use
See fabric/scripts/fabric-samples/test-network/how-to-use.txt.

I modified the scripts to support flexible orgs-adding feature, the entry is in mynetwork.sh, so remember to use mynetwork.sh instead of network.sh.

Also, I provide a bash script auto-test.sh to easily execute the whole test workflow.
